**Revenue cost function**

- Cost minimization problem interms of producing a certain amount of revenue

- $$\min_{z \geq 0} C(w, z) \quad \text{subject to} \quad p_s \cdot z_s \geq R_s \quad \text{for } s = 1, \dots, S$$

- Lagrangian: $$\mathcal{L} = C(w, z) + \sum_{s=1}^S \lambda_s (R_s - p_s \cdot z_s)$$

- \textbf{Steps to Solve:}

- Take the first-order conditions (FOCs) with respect to $z_s$ and the state-contingent Lagrangian multipliers $\lambda_s$.

- Solve for the state-contingent supply curves $z^*(w, R, p)$.

- Substitute $z^*(w, R, p)$ into the conditional cost function:
    $$
    C(w, R, p) = C(w, z^*(w, R, p)).
   $$

- Certainty equivalent:$$
    ce^{R}(w, R, p) = max_{e}{e\in R: C(w, p, e1^{s}) \leq C(w, R, p)}$$

## Exercise 1

Consider the cost function $C(w, z) = w_1^{\frac{3}{5}} w_2^{\frac{2}{5}} z_1 z_2$ where w are input price, z are outputs and $\beta$ is a constant parameter. Note that this cost function is derived from a production possibility set that is nonempty, closed, and satisfies weak free disposal of inputs and outputs. Suppose that $z_1$ represents output in state 1 and $z_2$ represents output in state 2 of an uncertain world.
If $p_1$ is the price received for output in state 1 and $p_2$ is the price received for output in state 2, derive the producer’s **revenue cost function.**

- Simply note that only one output is being produced in each state, so:$R_1 = p_1z_1, R_2 = p_2z_2$

- $c = w_1^{\frac{3}{5}} w_2^{\frac{2}{5}} z_1^{*} z_2^{*}$

**Expected Profit Maximization**

- Question: Why does a risk neutral producer facing uncertainty solve this problem rather than maximizing their expected utility?

- Answer: Risk neutrality $⇒ E(u(π))=u(Eπ)$

- max$ϕ⋅π$

- $max_{R≥0}ϕ⋅(R−C(p,w,R)1^{S})$

**Utility Maximization for a Risk Averse Producer**

- Risk averse $⇒E(u(π))≤u(Eπ)$ i.e. i.e. $W(π)≤W(\bar{π}1^{S})$

- $W(π)$ is the producer’s utility of profit across different states, where $π=(π_1,⋯,π_S)$

- Subjective probability beliefs:$\phi_s = \frac{W_s(1_s)}{\sum_{t=1}^S W_t(1_s)}$, where $W_s = \frac{\delta W(\pi)}{\delta \pi_s}$

- Optimization Problem:$$
    \max_{R \geq 0} W(R - C(p, w, R) 1_S) \textbf{ with FOCs:}\\ 
     W_s(\pi^*) - \sum_{t=1}^S W_t(\pi^*) \frac{\partial C(p, w, R^*)}{\partial R_s} \leq 0\\
     \left[W_s(\pi^*) - \sum_{t=1}^S W_t(\pi^*) \frac{\partial C(p, w, R^*)}{\partial R_s}\right] R^*_s = 0$$
     
- Certainty equivalent:$$
    ce(\pi)= min_{c}({c \in R}:W(c1^{s}) \geq W(\pi)))$$

## Exercise 2

Consider an uncertain world with only two mutually exclusive states denoted by a and b. A producer produces output $z_a≥0$ in state a and $z_b≥0$ in state b with two inputs, x1 and x2, at a cost of,$$
C(w_1, w_2, z_a, z_b) = 2 w_1^{\frac{1}{2}} w_2^{\frac{1}{2}} (z_a^2 + z_b^2)$$
Given this cost function, the competitive producer’s profits in states a and b are:
$$
\pi_a = p_a z_a - 2 w_1^{\frac{1}{2}} w_2^{\frac{1}{2}} (z_a^2 + z_b^2),
\pi_b = p_b z_b - 2 w_1^{\frac{1}{2}} w_2^{\frac{1}{2}} (z_a^2 + z_b^2)
$$
Question 1)  For the state contingent output za and zb, what are the producer’s **conditional input demands?**

- Shephard'e lemma

-----------------------

Question 2) Suppose a risk averse producer’s utility of profit function is $W(\pi_a, \pi_b) = 3 - e^{-\mu \pi_a} - 2 e^{-\mu \pi_b}$.

2.i) **What are the producer’s subjective probabilities for state a and b?**

- First calculate $W_a$ and $W_b$, then use formula of subjective probability

- $\phi_a = 1/3$, $\phi_b = 2/3$

2.ii) For $π_a$ and $π_b$ in general, what is the producer’s **certainty equivalent profit?**

- $$ce = \frac{1}{\mu}ln(\frac{3}{(\frac{1}{e^{\mu\pi_a}} + \frac{2}{e^{\mu\pi_b}})})$$

------------------

Question 3) Suppose instead that the producer is risk neutral with subjective probability beliefs $ϕ_a>0$ and $ϕ_b>0$ for state a and 

3.i) **Find this producer’s optimal outputs for states a and b**. You can assume the solution is interior.

- Expected Profit Maximization:$$
   max_{z_a, z_b} E\pi = \phi_a\pi_a + \phi_b\pi_b$$
   
- $z_a^{*}= \frac{\phi_a p_a}{4(\phi_a+\phi_b)w_1^{1/2}w_2^{1/2}}, z_b^{*}= \frac{\phi_b p_b}{4(\phi_a+\phi_b)w_1^{1/2}w_2^{1/2}}$

3.ii) Given these optimal outputs, what are the producer’s **unconditional input demands?**

- Use Shephard's lemma to get conditional input demand and then use duality to convert them into $x_1^*$ and $x_2^*$.

## Exercise 3

![](pic1.png)

-----------------

a) Set up the **manufacture’s utility maximization problem** and derive the first-order conditions for an interior solution for q.

- The manufacturer's optimization problem is:$$
    max_{q}\quad W(pq-c(q), (p-t)q-c(q))$$

- FOC:$$
   W_N(p-c^{'}(q)) + W_T((p-t)- c^{'}(q))=0$$
  
- $$p -\frac{W_N}{W_N+W_T}t = c^{'}(q)$$

---------------

b) If the manufacture finds out if there is going to be tariff beofre choosing its ouputs it's state contingent profits are:$$
    y^{N}(q^{N}) = pq^{N} - c(q^{N}),  \quad y^{T}(q^{T}) = (p-t) q^{T} - c(q^{T})$$
**Set up the manufacture’s utility maximization problem and derive its first-order conditions for an interior solution** on $q^N4 and $q^T$. 

- The manufacturer's optimization problem is:$$
    max_{q}\quad W(pq^{N}-c(q^{N}), (p-t)q^{T}-c(q^{T}))$$

- FOC:$$
   W_N(p-c^{'}(q^{N})) + W_T((p-t)- c^{'}(q^{T}))=0$$
   
- $p= c^{'}(q^{N}), p-t = ^{'}(q^{T})$

------------------

**c) Which if the three output is largest?**

- $p > p -\frac{W_N}{W_N+W_T}t > p-t$

- $c^{'}(q) > 0, c^{''}(q) > 0$

- $q^{N} > q > q^{T}$
