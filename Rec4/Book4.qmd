**Equivalent variation**

 $$\begin{align*}
    EV(p_0, p_1, w) &= e(p_0, u_1) - e(p_0, u_0) \\
    &= e(p_0, u_1) - w \\
    &= \int_{p_0}^{p_1} h_1(p_1, \bar{p}_{-1}, u_1) dp_1
\end{align*}$$

- EV shows how much wealth would have had to increase (decrease) under the OLD prices to lead to the NEW utility attained under the new prices.If $EV < 0$, the consumer will be worse off after the price change.

**Compensating variation** 

$$\begin{align*}
    CV(p_0, p_1, w) &= e(p_1, u_1) - e(p_1, u_0) \\
    &= w - e(p_1, u_0) \\
    &= \int_{p_0}^{p_1} h_1(p_1, \bar{p}_{-1}, u_0) dp_1
\end{align*}$$

- CV shows how much wealth, under the NEW prices, must be given to (or taken from) a planner to keep the consumer at the OLD level of utility.If $CV < 0$, the consumer will be worse off after the price change.

**Consider the utility function** $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1^\beta x_2^{1-\beta}$, with budget constraint $w = p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2$ and ($0 < \beta < 1$).**Use utility maximization to derive the Walrasian demands** $x_1(p, w)$ and $x_2(p, w)$.

- $x_1^* = \frac{w \beta}{p_1}$, $x_2^* = \frac{w (1-\beta)}{p_2}$

- Use your answer  to derive the indirect utility function and the expenditure
function for this consume.

- $$v(p, w) = u = \left( \frac{w \beta}{p_1} \right)^\beta \left( \frac{w (1-\beta)}{p_2} \right)^{1-\beta} = w \beta^\beta (1-\beta)^{1-\beta} p_1^{-\beta} p_2^{-(1-\beta)} $$

- $$e(p, u) = p_1 h_1 + p_2 h_2 = u \left[ p_1^\beta p_2^{1-\beta} \beta^{-\beta} (1-\beta)^{-(1-\beta)} \right] $$

Assume that β = 0.5, and that w = 100. Assume also that initial prices are p1 = p2 = 1.
Suppose that the price of x2 increases to p2 = 8. **Calculate the equivalent variation
(EV) for this price change. Explain in words what it means.**

- EV is defined as $$EV(p_0, p_1, w) = e(p_0, u_1) - w$$

- First calculate $u^1$ - the utility the consumer obtains at new higher prices:
    $$\begin{align*}
    v &= 100(0.5/1)^{0.5}(0.5/8)^{0.5} \\
    &= 25/\sqrt {2}
\end{align*}$$

 - Now plug this into your solution for the expenditure function, using the new utility but the old price:
    $$\begin{align*}
    e(p_1, p_2, u) &= (25/2^{0.5})(1/0.5)^{0.5}(1/0.5)^{0.5}\\
    &= 25\sqrt {2}
\end{align*}$$

- EV = 25$\sqrt {2}$ - 100 = -50

Continue to assume that β = 0.5, w = 100, initial prices are p1 = p2 = 1, and that the
price of x2 increases to 4. Calculate the compensating variation (CV) for this price
change. Explain in words what it means.

- CV is defined as $$CV(p_0, p_1, w) =  w - e(p_1, u_0)$$

- First calculate $u^0$ - the original utility of consumer:
    $$\begin{align*}
    v &= 100(0.5/1)^{0.5}(0.5/1)^{0.5} \\
    &= 50
\end{align*}$$

-  Now plug this into your solution for the expenditure function, using the old utility but the new price:
    $$\begin{align*}
    e(p_1, p_2, u) &= 50(1/0.5)^{0.5}(4/0.5)^{0.5}\\
    &= 200
\end{align*}$$

- CV = 100 -200 = -100

**Use these indirect utility functions to derive aggregate demand. **Is it possible to write this aggregate demand as just a function of aggregate wealth (i.e., $( W = w_a + w_b )$) and prices?

-   Roy's identity:

- $$x_{1a}(p_1, p_2, w_a) = -\frac{\partial v_a(p_1, p_2, w_a)}{\partial p_1} \Big/ \frac{\partial v_a(p_1, p_2, w_a)}{\partial W} = \frac{w_a}{4p_1}$$

- $$x_{2a}(p_1, p_2, w_a) = -\frac{\partial v_a(p_1, p_2, w_a)}{\partial p_2} \Big/ \frac{\partial v_a(p_1, p_2, w_a)}{\partial W} = \frac{3w_a}{4p_2}$$

- $$x_{1b}(p_1, p_2, w_b) = \frac{w_b}{2p_1}, x_{2b}(p_1, p_2, w_b) = \frac{w_b}{2p_2}$$

- Sum up individual demand to get aggregate:$$
    x_1(p_1, p_2, w_a, w_b) = \frac{w_a + 2w_b}{4p_1}$$
    $$
    x_2(p_1, p_2, w_a, w_b) = \frac{3w_a + 2w_b}{4p_2}$$
    
- **No ???**

Consider the social welfare function $U(u_a, u_b) = u_a^{\frac{1}{3}} u_b^{\frac{2}{3}}$. **Set up the social welfare maximization problem for distributing aggregate wealth W between a and b and derive the first-order conditions.**

- The social welfare maximization problem is:$$
    \max U(u_a, u_b) = u_a^{\frac{1}{3}} u_b^{\frac{2}{3}} = \left( \frac{w_a}{p_1^{\frac{1}{4}} p_2^{\frac{3}{4}}} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \left( \frac{w_b}{p_1^{\frac{1}{2}} p_2^{\frac{1}{2}}} \right)^{\frac{2}{3}} s.t. W = w_a + w_b$$

- The Lagrangian is:$$
    \mathcal{L} = \left( \frac{w_a}{p_1^{\frac{1}{4}} p_2^{\frac{3}{4}}} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \left( \frac{w_b}{p_1^{\frac{1}{2}} p_2^{\frac{1}{2}}} \right)^{\frac{2}{3}} + \lambda(W - w_a - w_b)$$

- F.O.C are:$$
    \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w_a} = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{1}{p_1^{\frac{1}{4}} p_2^{\frac{3}{4}}} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \left( \frac{1}{p_1^{\frac{1}{2}} p_2^{\frac{1}{2}}} \right)^{\frac{2}{3}}\left( \frac{w^b}{w^a} \right)^{\frac{2}{3}} - \lambda = 0$$
   $$
   \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w_b} = \frac{2}{3} \left( \frac{w_a}{p_1^{\frac{1}{4}} p_2^{\frac{3}{4}}} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \left( \frac{w^b}{p_1^{\frac{1}{2}} p_2^{\frac{1}{2}}} \right)^{\frac{2}{3}}\left( \frac{w^a}{w^b} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} - \lambda = 0$$

**Use these first-order conditions to find the wealth distribution rule that maximizes social welfare. Is this wealth distribution rule homogeneous of degree 1 in prices and wealth?**

- Solving for an interior solution:$$
    w^b = 2w^a$$

- From these, solve for the wealth distribution rule:$$
    w_a = \frac{1}{3}W, \quad w_b = \frac{2}{3}W$$
    
 - This rule is homogeneous of degree 1 in prices and wealth because $w_a(\alpha p_1, \alpha p_2, \alpha W) = \alpha w_a(p_1, p_2, W)$  and similarly for $w_b$.

--------------

**Derive the value function for this social welfare optimization problem by substituting the wealth distribution rule back into the objective function. How can you derive implied demands from this value function? **

- Substituting the wealth distribution rule into the objective function:$$
    V(p_1, p_2, W) = \left( \frac{\frac{1}{3}W}{p_1^{\frac{1}{4}} p_2^{\frac{3}{4}}} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \left( \frac{\frac{2}{3}W}{p_1^{\frac{1}{2}} p_2^{\frac{1}{2}}} \right)^{\frac{2}{3}}$$
    
 - Taking the derivative with respect to $p_1$, $p_2$, and $W$, and using Roy’s Identity, we find our demand functions. 
 
- These should match the aggregate demands from part (a).

--------------

**Under what conditions can we theoretically justify using this avalue function for welfare analysis**

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
- We need to satisfy three conditions:

- **(a)**: wealth distribution rule that is homogeneous of degree 1 in p1, p2, and W;

- **(b)**: V(p1, p2, W) satisfy the properties of an indirect utility function:

    - HOD: 0 in p and w
    
    - nonincreasing in p1 and p2, and strictly increasing in W
    
    - quasiconvex in p1 and p2
    
    - continuous in p1, p2, and W
    
- **(c)**: V(p1, p2, W) to return our aggregate demands when aggregate demand is evaluated at our wealth distribution rule
    
- If it satisfies all this we can say **value function represents preferences of a Normative Representative Consumer that we can use for welfare analysis.**
